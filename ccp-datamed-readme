## Welcome to the Cloud Commons Pilot CEDAR Metadata Pipeline

**Introduction**  

This document describes how to use the Cloud Commons Pilot (CCP) CEDAR Metadata pipeline.

The CCP metadata pipeline helps investigators submit complete and validated metadata about their digital objects,  providing a seamless interface to transmit metadata to the DataMed repository. The CCP pipeline attempts to improve quality of the CCP metadata and advance the broader goal of data FAIRness.

**TLDR Version**

Just want to get started? Here's what you need to do. Click on the Create CCP Metadata link below this paragraph (create an account/log in to CEDAR if you need to), and when your metadata can be indexed by DataMed, set the Ready to Index attribute at the top of the template to "Ready to Index". That's it. (You might want to read the section "What I need to fill out" below, too.)

[Create CCP Digital Object Metadata](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org/instances/create/https://repo.metadatacenter.org/templates/62c8b5f2-7dc9-4fff-9008-07c95a746411)

**1) Get a CEDAR login**  

To use this pipeline, you will need an account on the CEDAR Workbench. If you do not have one, you can [create one](https://auth.metadatacenter.org/auth/realms/CEDAR/login-actions/registration?client_id=cedar-angular-app). If you stay logged in the next step should be seamless.

**2) Fill out the metadata**

Click on the Create CCP Digital Object Metadata link above. (Log in if not already logged in.) 

You should see the metadata form ready to fill out. Click on the arrows in the form to open or close sections.

We suggest you save the metadata form relatively often, just so you don't accidentally close the tab and lose your work. 

To verify the form is saved, use the left arrow at upper left to back out to the folder you were in before clicking on the link (likely your home folder). You should see a form entitled "BioCADDIE Digital Object metadata". Double-click on this form to resume editing your metadata.

**3) Submit the metadata**

To indicate the metadata is ready to be indexed, set the first value (called "Ready to Index") to "Ready to Index". When DataMed sees that setting, it will begin indexing your metadata.

**4) Verify your metadata is in DataMed**
