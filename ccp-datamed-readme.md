## Welcome to the Cloud Credits Model Pilot CEDAR Metadata Pipeline

**Introduction**  

This document describes how to describe your Digital Object(s) with the Cloud Credits Model Pilot (CCP) CEDAR Metadata pipeline.

The CCP metadata pipeline helps investigators submit complete and validated metadata about their digital objects and provides an easy way to transmit metadata to the DataMed repository, while (we hope) improving the quality and FAIRness of your metadata.

**Summary**

Just want to go do it? Here you go.

Click on the Create CCP Digital Object Metadata link below this paragraph (create an account/log in to CEDAR if you need to), and when your metadata can be indexed by DataMed, set the Ready to Index attribute at the top of the template to "True". That's it, except we really value your input to fill out the survey. (And reading the section "What I need to fill out" below could save you time.)

[Create CCP Digital Object Metadata](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org/instances/create/https://repo.metadatacenter.org/templates/62c8b5f2-7dc9-4fff-9008-07c95a746411)

[Fill Out Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ccp-metadata-survey)   Please take 5 minutes with this optional survey to tell us how your process went. This is not required by NIH or the Cloud Credits Pilot, but it will help the developers of CEDAR immensely.

**1) Get a CEDAR login**  

To use this pipeline, you will need an account on the CEDAR Workbench. If you do not have one, you can [create one](https://auth.metadatacenter.org/auth/realms/CEDAR/login-actions/registration?client_id=cedar-angular-app). If you stay logged in the next step should be seamless.

**2) Fill out the metadata**

Click on the Create CCP Digital Object Metadata link above. (Log in if not already logged in.) 

You should see the metadata form ready to fill out. Click on the arrows in the form to open or close sections.

We suggest you save the metadata form often, just so you don't accidentally close the tab and lose your work. 

To verify the form is saved, use the left arrow at upper left to back out to the folder you were in before clicking on the link (likely your home folder). You should see a metadata item entitled "CCP Digital Object metadata". Double-click on this item to resume editing your metadata.  

Your form will not be visible to anyone who isn't a manager of this process, unless you share it using CEDAR's Share feature. Of course when you Submit the Metadata (below), it will be indexed by DataMed and visible to any DataMed user.

***What do I need to fill out?***
The required attributes are marked with a red asterisk.

We would like you to provide a filled-out form for each of your Digital Objects, if you do not have too many. The sections of the form that need to be filled out depend on the object being submitted. Only fill out those sections which describe your Digital Object.

If you have a few Digital Objects of different types, or a few Digital Objects that are very different, please consider filling out a form for each one, as this will better promote your work. If this is too hard, you can fill out one form to describe your 'bag' of Digital Objects; just set the Composite Submission attribute to True, use the Distribution section to list each object, and fill out the rest of the fields to describe the whole bag. We recommend you have a resolvable identifier (a URL) for your whole bag, so that someone who wants more information can visit that web location to learn more.

For any section that you are filling out, please fill out as many of the attributes as you can. Remember, these entries are advertising your Digital Object to the community, so the more you fill out, the better the chances people can find, cite, and re-use your Digital Objects.

**3) Submit the metadata**

To indicate the metadata is ready to be indexed, set the "Ready to Index" value to "True". When DataMed sees that setting, it will begin indexing your metadata.

You can change the metadata any time later on in the CEDAR Workbench. If the Ready to Index flag is True, DataMed will update the metadata on the next indexing pass. As long as the Ready to Index flag is not True, DataMed will ignore any changes.

**4) Verify your metadata is in DataMed**

After a suitable time has passed (indexing can take up to two days), visit the DataMed web site to verify that your metadata has been added. You can look up your metadata entries in DataMed using the Digital Object Identifier you provided. To make sure the metadata is from CEDAR, you can find the source of the metadata in DataMed by ...

**5) Fill out our survey**

If you are willing to spend 5-10 minutes to help us greatly (less time than reading this!), please fill out the [voluntary survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cpp-metadata-survey). This is not required by NIH or the Cloud Credits Pilot, but it will help the developers of CEDAR immensely.
